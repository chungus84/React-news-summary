                    "bodyText": "The Centre for Public Integrity has urged Victorian MPs to implement sweeping integrity reforms before November’s state election following a damning investigation into branch stacking and the misuse of taxpayer funds. On Wednesday the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said he took full responsibility for the “disgraceful” conduct uncovered in a damning report into Labor branch stacking, as he apologised to the public and vowed to implement sweeping reform. Andrews said the government had accepted all 21 recommendations in the report and would “go further” by introducing legislation to restrict political parties in the state from receiving public funding unless they meet a set of criteria designed to stamp out corrupt behaviour. Criteria would include requiring party memberships to be paid by traceable means, implementing mandatory identification checks for new members joining a political party and measures to ensure compliance in the use of the electoral roll. The Centre for Public Integrity’s research director, Dr Catherine Williams, said if no elements of the reform were enacted before parliament rises in September - two months out of the November election - it would be a “terrible shame” and a “lost opportunity.” “These are issues that should have been addressed a long time ago,” Williams told Guardian Australia. “The ombudsman raised concerns about these issues, as we know, in the ‘red shirts’ report back in 2018 and very little has changed since that time.” The ombudsman’s report into the so-called red shirts affair found taxpayer funds were used to pay electorate officers campaigning for Labor during the 2014 election. A year after the report was handed down, police dropped their investigation into the matter. Williams comments came after Andrews said the Victorian Labor party has made “massive changes to our rules” in the two years since the allegations that led to the integrity investigation were first aired. Released Wednesday, the report of Operation Watts – a joint investigation between the state’s ombudsman and the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) uncovered widespread misuse of taxpayer resources for political purposes and a “catalogue” of unethical behaviour in the Victorian branch of the Labor party including nepotism, the hiring of unqualified people for public roles and using those roles for political party work. Responding to the report, Andrews said the behaviour uncovered did not meet his expectations or those held by Victorians. “As leader of the parliamentary Labor party and the premier of our state, I take full responsibility for all of that conduct. That’s what the top job is all about and I apologise for it,” he said. The state’s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, claimed the proposed reform agenda would be the largest overhaul of a parliament’s integrity structures in the nation, after the report concluded Victoria had become a “laggard rather than a leader in parliamentary integrity”. Williams said the reforms proposed by the Andrews government were “really significant” and could amount to the largest overhaul of a parliamentary integrity system in Australia if enacted as proposed While the report focused on the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, Williams said it should galvanise the entire parliament to enact integrity changes to stamp out integrity risks. “This report is a real opportunity to introduce substantial reform and we would not want to see that opportunity lost,” she said. Among the report’s recommendations are the establishment of an independent parliamentary integrity commissioner that could order sanctions, a ban MPs from being able to employ family members in their electorate office, the creation of a new offence for ministers would make it unlawful for ministers to allow a person to perform party political work while employed in a publicly funded role. In line with the report’s recommendations, the government said it would aim to create the new integrity framework by June 2024. The acting leader of the Victorian Greens, Tim Read, said reforms “may be necessary” to clean up the wide-scale branch stacking within the Labor Party. But he said it did not mean it was vital for other political parties that could “manage their internal affairs appropriately”. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, claimed the Andrews government was “mired in corruption, cover-ups, and political games at the expense of Victorians” and hence unfit to govern the state. The report said Andrews, who was questioned in private, had agreed branch stacking was a serious problem and “could amount to a corruption risk” as it could lead to the misuse of taxpayer funds for political purposes. The report found two former Andrews government ministers – the moderate faction leader Adem Somyurek and Marlene Kairouz – breached parliamentary codes of conduct when they misused public funds to fuel a vast branch-stacking operation. Despite describing their conduct as egregious, it concluded there was not enough proof they had committed criminal offences to recommend prosecution. The report found while branch stacking – the practice of large-scale recruitment of non-genuine members to influence the outcome of votes within Labor branches – was a common and longstanding practice it found no evidence of potential misuse of public funds within other factions. Kairouz stood down as a minister after an investigation by the Age and 60 Minutes into branch stacking was published in June 2020, while Somyurek was dumped from the ministry. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Somyurek said on Wednesday he was “liberated” after the investigation stopped short of concluding he had committed criminal offences. “On the one level, I’m happy. I’m relieved. I feel exonerated. I feel some good emotions on the one side because I’m finally getting my life back. But on the other side, I’m very angry,” he said. Somyurek said he had “done absolutely nothing wrong” and claimed while branch stacking was common place in the Labor party he had only engaged in it for one-and-a-half months. But Glass rejected Somyurek’s assertion that the former minister had been “exonerated” and said there was “no shadow of doubt” the conduct of the two former ministers was “egregious”."

                    "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is taking PMQs at 12pm. With the Commons starting its summer recess tomorrow, and the winner of the Tory leadership election due to be announced when parliament returns on Monday 5 September, this will be Johnson’s last time doing these exchanges. We suspect he hoped he would not be here. Last week he implied that for some reason he might be absent this week. But he’s here. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. In an analysis of the yesterday’s public sector pay awards published this morning, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank says the new prime minister will have to decide whether to increase departmental spending budgets, to fund the higher-than-expected pay awards, or to require the awards to be funded from existing budgets, requiring cuts elsewhere. It says: One option is to top up spending plans to at least partially fund the costs of higher-than-expected pay awards, shoring up departments’ ability to deliver on the government’s public service objectives (such as clearing the NHS backlog). This would come at the cost of higher borrowing and reduced fiscal room for the tax cuts seemingly desired by the entire field of would-be prime ministers. The other option is to stick to existing spending plans, instead requiring public services to make some painful cuts: to other budgets, to headcount, or to the range and quality of service provision. Reducing the government’s public services ‘offer’ is a coherent response to a series of global economic shocks that make us poorer as a nation. But the government should be honest about what that implies for the NHS, local government, and other public services. Penny Mordaunt, the international trade minister and Tory leadership candidate, has proposed a project to compose a new UK theme tune. She made the comment in an interview with the Spectator in which she paid tribute to the old UK theme (a medley of British tunes), which used to be played at the crack of down on Radio 4 until it was replaced by a news broadcast. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, has described Rishi Sunak’s promise to maintain the ban on new onshore windfarms as “economic illiteracy”. He said: As Britain boils in an unprecedented heatwave, it is economic illiteracy and unilateral economic disarmament in the fight against the climate crisis that Rishi Sunak wants to keep the ban on onshore wind. Anyone with such dangerous views is not a serious candidate for high office. But this is the reality: a Conservative leadership race in which candidates have engaged in fantasy climate denial that will lead to higher energy bills, damage our security and burdens future generations with extreme weather events. My colleague Peter Walker has more on the reaction to Sunak’s promise in his story here. Robert Colvile, the Sunday Times columnist and head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, says he is baffled by Rishi Sunak’s pledge to ban onshore windfarms (see 9.17am) – because Tory voters are mostly in favour of them. Colvile co-wrote the Conservative party manifesto in 2019 with Rachel Wolf. She also thinks the Sunak announcement is a mistake. Damian Green, the former first secretary of state and chair of the One Nation Conservatives group, has endorsed Penny Mordaunt for leader. Previously he was backing Tom Tugendhat. Green said: I have thought long and hard about what to do in today’s leadership ballot and I will be voting for Penny Mordaunt. She offers a fresh start and a chance to unify the party and deliver for the country. Simon Clarke was doing the morning interview round for the government this morning. He was ostensibly speaking in his capacity as chief secretary to the Treasury (in which capacity he backs the government’s tax policies, including the national insurance increase), but he was also answering questions as a supporter of Liz Truss’s leadership campaign (which believes the national insurance increase was a mistake). Understandably, at time this was confusing. Here are the main points from his interviews. Clarke suggested that, if Truss became leader, the government might abandon some of its current spending plans. He told LBC [Rishi Sunak] was delivering against the spending plans set out by the current prime minister, Boris Johnson. Those spending plans do not automatically need to be the case under a new prime minister. That will be my crucial difference with Rishi. I don’t believe those plans should be regarded as set in stone. With a new leader come new choices, and Liz has set out very clearly the things that she would prioritise, which includes tax cuts. I think that must be right. Clarke refused to say whether he had told Sunak that he disagreed with the national insurance increase. Speaking on the Today programme, Clarke pointed out that he only became chief secretary to the Treasury after that increase had been agreed. Asked if he had told Sunak he thought it was a mistake, he said: “We are bound by collective responsibility.” He claimed he was not being inconsistent in backing one tax policy as a Treasury minister, while also backing an alternative approach as a supporter of the Truss campaign. The election of a new leader would allow policy to change, he said: We are right on the cusp of electing a new leader of the Conservative party and prime minister and it will be for that leader to make new choices. Liz is clear, if she is elected there will be a new spending review, which will take effect from day one. I believe it is absolutely the case with a new leader comes new choices. He said he was backing Truss for leader because she had an “exciting plan for growth”. He said: I think she has the most exciting plan for economic growth and she set out a compelling plan to lower the burden of taxation. I have very high regard for Rishi Sunak. I am here to make the case for what I think is the right future step in terms of where we go from here and that is for a government led by Liz Truss. He defended the decision to remove the whip from Tobias Ellwood for missing the confidence vote on Monday (see 9.45am), saying that Ellwood made a “very serious mistake”. Clarke explained: He was in Moldova, rather than Ukraine. He was not on government work, he is a backbench MP. He defended the decision to offer public sector workers below-inflation pay awards. He said: It is crucially important, when setting public sector pay for the people who do so much hard work for our society, that we strike the right balance between managing the risk of worsening inflation, of baking it in and making it worse by setting very high pay deals while also looking after our workforce, and obviously the offer that is being made to the public sector has to be seen in the context of that £37bn package of support which is designed to help family incomes. He said today’s inflation figure was “very fractionally higher” than had been expected. Penny Mordaunt seemed to be telling Tory MPs this morning they would “murder” the Conservative party if they voted for one of her rivals. She posted a message on Twitter saying “Tory MPs – vote for Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss today and you’ll murder the party you love”, although the tweet has now been deleted. In fact, Mordaunt was just quoting the headline on a Daily Telegraph column that she is tweeting. It’s by Allison Pearson, and in it she says “it is Mordaunt, the Royal Navy reservist and centrist, who can unite our divided country and, most crucially, prevent a Tory wipe-out at the next election.” Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the Commons defence committee who had the whip removed for missing Monday’s confidence vote, told Sky News this morning that his party risked “a long spell in opposition” because of the infighting taking place. He said: The nation wants to be impressed and inspired, not demoralised, by what they’re witnessing right now. And we need to perhaps exhibit greater decorum, dial the temperature down a bit, showcase the ideas, the vision, focus on those things that are important, that the nation wants to see. That’s what will earn us the right to stay in government otherwise, we’re just going to be letting ourselves down and indeed committing ourselves to probably a long spell in opposition. Ellwood missed the vote because he could not return in time from a visit to Moldova. He said that he was sorry he could not get to the Commons in time, and that he kept the whips’ office informed of his situation. “There were a problems with travel,” he said. “I am very sorry I didn’t make it back.” The removal of the whip means Ellwood can no longer vote in the parliamentary ballot for the Tory leadership, and Ellwood refused to comment on speculation that he was penalised because he is backing Penny Mordaunt, not the de facto No 10 candidate, Liz Truss. Explaining why he did not want to comment, he said: I’d be then fuelling the blue-on-blue [attacks], which I’m actually trying to avoid. Let’s focus on how we can move forward and make sure that we conclude this leadership campaign to the highest professional standard that I think the British people want to see. Rising petrol and diesel prices for motorists and dearer food pushed Britain’s annual inflation rate to a fresh 40-year high of 9.4% last month, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. Good morning. Boris Johnson will take PMQs for the last time as prime minister at 12pm, and an hour later Conservative MPs will start voting in what should be the last parliamentary leadership ballot. At 4pm we should know who the two candidates will be on the ballot for party members. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is almost certain to be on it, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, is likely to be there too, but Penny Mordaunt, the international trade secretary, has been in second place in all four previous ballots and she has a chance too. All three candidates are making last-minute appeals to Tory MPs. Sunak has promised to maintain the rules that in effect ban new onshore windfarms in England. He made the pledge as he promised that he would also set a new “energy sovereignty” target for 2045, so that at that point the UK produces as much energy as it uses. Sunak said: I am committed to net zero by 2050, but that can’t mean neglecting our energy security. So although the legal target for energy sovereignty will be 2045 and I will work night and day to ensure we beat that target, securing a safer future for the next generation. Wind energy will be an important part of our strategy, but I want to reassure communities that as prime minister I would scrap plans to relax the ban on onshore wind in England, instead focusing on building more turbines offshore. David Cameron’s government stopped the creation of new onshore windfarms in England by excluding them from subsidies available for other forms of renewable energy and tightening the planning laws, making it easier for communities to block developments. Johnson’s government has floated the prospect of lifting these restrictions. Although onshore wind is a cheap form of renewable energy, the turbines are particularly unpopular with activists in Tory constituencies. Truss has said that she will lead “a government of all the talents” is she becomes PM. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, in which she restates her commitment to reversing the national insurance rise and temporarily suspending the green levy on energy bill, she says: As prime minister, I would unite the party and lead a government of all the talents that includes the best and brightest from across the Conservatives. The quality of candidates that have taken part in this leadership race reflects how healthy our party is and how alive with ideas it remains. This implies MPs from all wings of the party could be included in her government. Truss’s supporters are also been reviving suggestions that Mordaunt is not experienced enough to be PM. Simon Clarke, a Truss supporter and chief secretary to the Treasury, said one reason why he was supporting Truss was that she was ready for the job “on day one”. Mordaunt has insisted that she is the only candidate offering “a genuine fresh start’. A source from her campaign team told journalists. Today is about continuity vs change for the Conservative party. Penny’s been speaking with colleagues already this morning and so many of Tom and Kemi’s backers are calling out for change. As the only one not in Johnson’s cabinet, Penny is the sole MP left in the race who offers a genuine fresh start. Not every candidate would win an election, but time and time again the polls show that Penny is the candidate Labour fear the most. MPs have a choice today - the same old or a new start for the Conservative party. Their colleagues, party members, and voters across the country are crying out for something new but only Penny Mordaunt can deliver that. Here is the agenda for the day. 12pm: Boris Johnson takes PMQs for the last time as prime minister, facing Keir Starmer. After 12.45pm: MPs begin the final day’s debate on the Northern Ireland protocol bill. 1pm: Conservative MPs start voting in the fifth parliamentary ballot for the party leadership. And it should be the final one, unless there is a draw, in which case a further ballot would take place. The ballot closes at 3pm. 4pm: Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, announces the results of the ballot - which should produce the names of the two candidates who will be on the final ballot for party members. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"
